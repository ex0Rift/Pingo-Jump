# Pingo Jump

### My first project for Midnight!

This is a thrilling platormer game made fully in python based around my character pingo!
Jump, Dash and roll to get to the end and mind the anoying spike balls and deep pits!

### This projects was made as one of my submitions to HackCLub midnight

[HackClub Midnight](https://midnight.hackclub.com "@HackClub")

It has pushed me to break what i thought my limits where in coding and try new challenges
and actually have fun doing it!
